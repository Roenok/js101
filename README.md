# GDI JS101: Intro to JavaScript

These slides are slightly modified from Pamela Fox's JS101 materials (found [here](https://github.com/pamelafox/teaching-materials)) to fit the GDI teaching template.

JS101 is meant to be taught in 4 classes, approximately 2.5 hours each (a total of 10 hours of instruction). Each session includes workshop slides with lecture notes, a series of in-class exercises, and homework to complete between classes.

## Class website

The class website and slides are available hosted [here](http://gdichicago.com/classes/js101/). You can teach this class using everything on that page.

The website includes slides, exercises, homework, and additional reading for each class.

**View notes on slides**: hit 's' and a new window will pop up with a presenter view, including notes, a timer, and some other useful goodies.

## Dependencies

All CSS and JavaScript used for this are hosted on AWS. You don't have to worry about them or pulling them down.

**Reveal.js**

These slides use [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) that has been edited for the GDI brand. You don't have to do anything to make it work, it should be there already.

If you don't have an internet connection, or you're worried about the internet not work, load the slides before you arrive at the workshop.

# Course description

*This is a four-week series, with classes being held on Mondays June 9, 16, 23, and 30 from 6-8:30PM. Makeup sessions are not offered.*

JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages interactive, and is now used these days to make servers, robots, and more. That makes it one of the most useful first languages to learn, if you're just getting started with programming, and particularly web development. 

This workshop is targeted at beginners to programming. If you already know another language, you're welcome to come, you'll probably find that you work at a faster pace.

**Cost:** $100

**Dates:** Mondays, June 9, 16, 23, and 30 from 6-8:30 PM each session

**Location:** Dev Bootcamp, 351 W Hubbard, Floor 7
